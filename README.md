# About me ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m currently working on my thesis, where I deploy a *BERT* model to predict polarization inside the US Congress
- Iâ€™m currently learning how to develop machine learning solutions to a wide range of task
- But most important I am looking for my first Data Science reletad job to tackle real life problems with effective solutions
