# About me ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m currently working on my thesis, where I deploy ML algorithms' predictive accuracy to measure polarization inside the US Congress
- I am enjoying the learning journey in using implementing machine learning solutions to a wide range of task
- But most important I am looking for my first Data Science reletad job to tackle real life problems with effective solutions
